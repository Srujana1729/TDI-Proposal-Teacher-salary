# Core concept
This project is an investigation into the evolution of public school teacher salaries. I plan to analyse the variation of teacher pay across states in the US, and also over time.

# Motivation
Teachers have the opportunity for immense impact on young children. Hence, it is essential to have talented, motivated teachers. One way to ensure this is by providing adequate pay. 

# Data sources

# Exploratory findings:
In my initial plots, I find that teacher pay varies greatly across the US (plot1). Moreover, the change over the years (1990 to 2018) has not bean comparable. Massachussetts, seems to be the state with the largest increase over these years, and it is also home to some of the best schools in the country. I plan to delve deeper to explore such ideas further.
